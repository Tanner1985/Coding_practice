# 1. Input a date in numeric format from the user e.g. mm/dd/yy.

# 2. Examine the month entered by the user. If it is larger than 12 or smaller than 1
# issue an error message and ask for input again. 

# 3. Perform similar validation tests for the date and year. Year must be 2013. (Any
# other year is invalid) In addition, the year must only be two digits long. 

# 4. Once all input has been validated, output the string in long date format. Thus a
# string that was input as 06/01/15 will be output as June 1, 2015.
