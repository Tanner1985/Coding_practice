# For this portion of the lab, you will create a new program for Professor Polanco (this is the
# last one!) Create a class named Student that holds the following data about a student:

# 1. Name

# performs the following tasks: 
# 1. Look up and print the student GPA
# 2. Add a new student to the class
# 3. Change the GPA of a student
# 4. Change the expected grade of a student
# 5. Print the data of all the students in a tabular format
