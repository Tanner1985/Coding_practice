#1. Ask the user for their name and their email address before you display the results
#of the conversions.

#2. When the user enters the email address search the string for the @ symbol. If the
#symbol is not found, ask the user to re-enter their email address till they get it right.

#3. When you display the conversion output to the user, you must include the userâ€™s

while '@' not in email:

# Get each value for conversion and make sure they are valid using a loop to allow for up to 3 attempts at the input
